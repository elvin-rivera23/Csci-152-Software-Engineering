As shown in the snippet, I was able to achieve 100% statement coverage, 100% branch coverage, roughly ~60% Loop Coverage, and 100% Term Coverage.
	-For the loop coverages I got stuck and did not know how to achieve 100% coverage.

I found it easy to make more test cases by reusing some of the older ones and checking cases that were normal and cases that were invalid.
I did find difficulty at first for testing _count5 but i realized that it was private so tested it using getGamestatus.
	- i also had a rough time figuring out how to check 5 for column up and row right.

I tried to avoid test cases that were repetitive like TruFalse , FalseTrue (only where needed) and tried sticking to test cases that were TrueTrue or FalseFalse
